 * Google App Engine serialises the tasks before queuing them, to keep a link between the task and the
 * {@link AppEngineAsyncConnection} associated, a register of the instances of {@code AppEngineAsyncConnection} is
 * kept in {@link #APP_ENGINE_ASYNC_CONNECTIONS}.<br />
 * This register is populated when a new instance of {@code AppEngineAsyncConnection} is created and the connection
 * is removed from the register when it has been closed with {@link #close()}.<br />
 * The register works based on identifier defined by the user. There is no ID conflict handling, the user is expected
 * to manage the uniqueness of those ID.
